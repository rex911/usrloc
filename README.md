The implementation of estimating Twitter users' locations using what they tweeted.

The whole thing is implemented using the [Theano](http://deeplearning.net/software/theano/) library.

The codes are written for experimental purposes, not as a commercial software. I apologize for any inconsitency with software engineering guidelines.
